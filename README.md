# CustomNavigationBar

This is a drop-in component for creating custom navigation bar for iPhone Apps.

It will allow you to setup subtitle as well in addition to the title. You can customize the theme by setting background color and other properties. I created this using Swift 4.2 but you can use it for 4 as well.

## Installation

This can be installed directly into your application via CocoaPods or by directly importing the source code files.

CocoaPods Installation

The recommended path for installation is CocoaPods. CocoaPods provides a simple, versioned dependency management system that automates the tedious and error prone aspects of manually configuring libraries and frameworks. You can add CustomNavigationbar to your project via CocoaPods by doing the following: ( Make sure you are in the Project folder in the terminal before setting up pods)

$ sudo gem install cocoapods

$ pod setup

Now create a Podfile in the root of your project directory and add the following:

pod 'CustomNavigationBar'

Complete the installation by executing:

$ pod install
